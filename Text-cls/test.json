WIDER PENETRATION\n  Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped\n  to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to\n  the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite\n  continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts\n  to extend world penetration.\n      Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln\n  guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.\n      Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's\n  leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,\n  said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.\n      The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,\n  Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,\n  where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.\n      Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker\n  foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.\n      Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the\n  increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila\n  S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly\n  in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The\n  company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in\n  restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.\n      Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit\n  next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had\n  already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.\n      Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the\n  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer\n  into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer\n  market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We\n  have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important\n  point,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken\n  had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\n      \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German\n  market, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that\n  while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a\n  taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very\n  regionalized.\n       Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for\n  African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most\n  important beer growth markets in the long term.\n       He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with\n  majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was\n  hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.\n      Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters\n  per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions\n  and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total\n  1986 sales.\n      On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price\n  of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists\n  have been looking at other possibilities.\n      To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on\n  the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which\n  had sold successfully, Coebergh said.\n      Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw\n  materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were\n  popular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not\n  possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.\n      Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to\n  penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a\n  contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.\n      But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's\n  market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that\n  are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western\n  money.\n  \n\n"], ["test/18569", "acq", "THOMSON GRAND PUBLIC TAKES OVER THORN EMI'S AUDIOVISUAL\nDIVISION - THOMSON\n\n  THOMSON GRAND PUBLIC TAKES OVER THORN EMI'S AUDIOVISUAL\n  DIVISION - THOMSON\n  \n\n"], ["test/15351", "crude", "RECENT U.S. OIL DEMAND OFF 2.6 PCT FROM YEAR AGO\n  U.S. oil demand as measured by\n  products supplied fell 2.6 pct in the four weeks ended April\n  three to 15.73 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 16.16 mln in the\n  same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration\n  (EIA) said.\n      In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy\n  Department agency said distillate demand was off 7.9 pct in the\n  period to 2.90 mln bpd from 3.15 mln a year earlier.\n      Gasoline demand averaged 6.76 mln bpd, off 3.1 pct from\n  6.98 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.15 mln\n  bpd, off 16.9 pct from 1.39 mln, the EIA said.\n      So far this year, distillate demand fell 2.3 pct to 3.20\n  mln bpd from 3.28 mln in 1986, gasoline demand was 6.63 mln\n  bpd, off 0.3 pct from 6.65 mln, and residual fuel demand fell\n  4.9 pct to 1.35 mln bpd from 1.42 mln, the EIA said.\n      Year-to-date domestic crude output was estimated at 8.40\n  mln bpd, off 7.6 pct from 9.09 mln a year ago, while gross\n  crude imports averaged 3.92 mln bpd, up 27.1 pct from 3.08 mln,\n  it said.\n  \n\n"], ["test/16432", "earn", "MICRO MASK INC &lt;NMS.O> 2ND QTR MAR 31 OPER LOSS\n  Oper shr loss 20 cts vs loss 63 cts\n      Oper net loss 439,000 vs loss 1,347,000\n      Sales 6,303,000 vs 5,062,000\n      Six mths\n      Oper shr loss 43 cts vs loss 1.02 dlrs\n      Oper net loss 934,000 vs loss 2,333,000\n      Sales 12.1 mln vs 9,878,000\n      Note: oper data does not include 1986 losses from\n  discontinued operations of 60,000 dlrs, or three cts per shr,\n  in qtr and 151,000 dlrs, or seven cts per shr, in six mths.\n  \n\n"], ["test/15451", "earn", "AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS\n  Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS>\n  reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln\n  guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits\n  for 1987.\n      Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion\n  guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985.

That spread has narrowed again.\n      \"A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,\"\n  said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.\n      Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is\n  justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and\n  the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a\n  percentage point.\n      He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage\n  points since last October until it fell below one point and\n  triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.\n      \"We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon\n  as this week,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.\n      \"We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the\n  near future,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.\n      \"Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding\n  costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,\"\n  said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.\n      However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime\n  because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan\n  demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain\n  recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.\n      Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift\n  short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He\n  said \"if there is widespread belief money market rates will\n  stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.\"\n      Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a\n  dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar\n  fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders\n  said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.\n      In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to\n  stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.\n  interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.\n      Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions\n  on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said \"it has become\n  clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure\n  in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.\"\n      Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest\n  rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation\n  that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.\n      That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the\n  market than most economists had expected.\n      On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small\n  amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements\n  with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another\n  high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct\n  today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr\n  round of customer repurchase agreements.\n      \"The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is\n  offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,\"\n  said Jones of Lanston.\n      \"The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the\n  need to defend the dollar,\" Jones said. He believes it is\n  merely shading policy toward restraint now, \"but to have a\n  major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy\n  overtly at some point.\"\n      Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by\n  becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within\n  four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.\n      Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might\n  well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to\n  further aid the dollar.\n      Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on\n  30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate\n  may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.\n      \"The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening\n  policy to defend the dollar,\" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He\n  said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.\n  Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures\n  abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.  \n  \n\n"], ["test/18895", "acq", "LEADER DEVELOPMENT &lt;LDCO.O> MERGER APPROVED\n  Leader Development Corp said\n  shareholders at the annual meeting approved the acquisition of\n  privately-held Clinton American Corp and two related\n  partnerships for 3,450,000 common shares, with the transaction\n  to be accounted for as a pooling of interests.\n      The company said Clinton president F.

Rothschild.\n      However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting\n  in September to re-evaluate market conditions.\n      Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the\n  fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a\n  day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000\n  barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president\n  of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.\n      Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this\n  meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to\n  offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated\n  throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,\n  producers receive less money for their oil.\n      \"The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,\"\n  said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.\n      \"In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to\n  produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act\n  as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two\n  dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,\" he\n  said.\n      One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.\n      \"The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian\n  Gulf,\" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache\n  Securites.\n      Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been\n  regular targets for Iranian planes.

But diminished\n  customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,\n  marketing incentives have helped their sales.\n      Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by\n  means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside\n  better priced grades in a \"package.\"\n      Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least\n  for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should\n  change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for\n  fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At\n  its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed\n  prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference\n  point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985\n  when members offered discounts to attract customers.\n      OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8\n  mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter\n  and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend\n  or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.\n      Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not\n  mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr\n  target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,\n  analysts say.\n      The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one\n  non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export\n  crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.\n  Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.\n      Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil\n  exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say\n  only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at\n  official prices, with some of the rest included in processing\n  or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.\n      Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,\n  when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to\n  pay the new prices.\n     Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude\n  -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --\n  was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.\n      In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below\n  its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,\n  due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has\n  risen.\n      Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say\n  its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.\n      But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort\n  Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the\n  differentials question in Vienna.\n      \"It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which\n  holds the presidency, raised the issue,\" he said.\n  \n\n"], ["test/20138", "earn", "DOW CHEMICAL CO &lt;DOW> 3RD QTR NET\n  Shr 1.72 dlrs vs 87 cts\n      Net 330,000,000 vs 167,000,000\n      Sales 3.36 billion vs 2.74 billion\n      Avg shrs 192,200,000 vs 191,700,000\n      Nine mths\n      Shr 4.62 dlrs vs 2.95 dlrs\n      Net 888,000,000 vs 564,000,000\n      Sales 9.78 billion vs 8.31 billion\n      Avg shrs 191,100,000 vs 191,500,000\n      NOTE: Earnings include a loss of 3.0 mln dlrs, or one ct a\n  share in the 1986 quarter from early extinguishment of debt\n      Earnings include losses in the nine months of 3.0 mln dlrs,\n  or two cts a share vs 8.0 mln dlrs, or four cts a share from\n  early extinguishment of debt\n  \n\n"], ["test/21336", "earn", "AT AND T &lt;T> 3RD QTR NET\n  Shr 47 cts vs 48 cts\n      Net 505.0 mln vs 533.0 mln\n      Revs 8.47 billion vs 8.43 billion\n      Nine mths.\n      Shr 1.42 dlrs vs 1.16 dlrs\n      Net 1.55 billion vs 1.31 billlion\n      Revs 25.0 billion vs 25.56 billion\n      NOTE: Full name is American Telephone and Telegraph Co.\n      NOTE: Prior quarter and nine mth net reduced by 25 mln\n  dlrs, or two cts per share, for estimated costs to reduce\n  workforce and consolidate various facilities.

credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday\n  for its last session before the Venice summit, banking\n  economists and money market dealers said.\n      The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month\n  by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is\n  unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates\n  in the near future, they said.\n      The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will\n  be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.\n      But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was\n  usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and\n  did not necessarily herald any policy moves.\n      Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today\n  there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply\n  growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was\n  stable against the mark.\n      Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has\n  opened a representative office, that the West German economy\n  was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted\n  1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.\n      Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in\n  a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the\n  Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a\n  minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.\n      \"They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe\n  lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or\n  Lombard,\" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,\n  Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.\n      Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said\n  German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and\n  around historical lows for West Germany.\n      A further cut in rates would have little impact on the\n  economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,\n  with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.\n      The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move\n  on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.\n  \"The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,\" he said.\n      A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in\n  line with the new structure of money market rates since last\n  month, would have little practical significance, dealers said.\n      The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a\n  diplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.\n      But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it\n  clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere \"eyewash.\"\n      Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to\n  cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary\n  policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.\n      But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax\n  cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget\n  deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.\n      \"The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in\n  Venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,\"\n  said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.\n      Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before\n  Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. \"But I\n  don't expect any convincing measures,\" he said.\n      Money market dealers noted that call money continued to\n  normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday\n  and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by\n  month-end distortions.\n      Call money could come under upwards pressure later this\n  month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on\n  behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.\n  Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.\n      Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds\n  tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55\n  pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,\n  and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.\n      But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would\n  allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not\n  represent a tightening of policy, however.\n      Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates\n  at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full\n  allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.\n      On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely\n  to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency\n  Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.\n      Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement\n  on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the\n  Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French\n  occupation this century.\n      But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come\n  this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still\n  to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be\n  treated for minimum reserve purposes.\n  \n\n"], ["test/19803", "earn", "DATA ARCHITECTS INC &lt;DAI> 2ND QTR MAY 31 NET\n  Shr 19 cts vs 16 cts\n

Redland held discussions on a\n  possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the\n  negotiations foundered on the price.\n      Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not\n  think ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid\n  although Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.\n      \"Redland is still in the driving seat,\" said Tim Cohen of\n  &lt;Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier having\n  CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.\n      Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid.\n  \n\n"], ["test/17773", "earn", "BRITISH LAND OF AMERICA INC &lt;BLA> YEAR MARCH 31\n  Shr loss 36 cts vs loss 57 cts\n      Net loss 4,589,000 vs loss 7,339,000\n      Revs 19.9 mln vs 19.6 mln\n      Avg shrs 14.7 mln vs 13.3 mln\n      NOTE: Company is a subsidiary of &lt;British Land Co PLC>\n  \n\n"], ["test/21007", "acq", "BROWN DISC TO BUY RHONE-POULENC &lt;RHON.PA> UNIT\n  Brown Disc Products Co\n  Inc, a unit fo Genevar Enterprises Inc, said it has purchased\n  the ongoing business, trademarks and certain assets of\n  Rhone-Poulenc's Brown Disc Manufacturing unit, for undisclosed\n  terms.\n      Rhone-Poulenc is a French-based chemical company.\n      Under the agreement, Rhone-Poulenc will supply magnetic\n  tape and media products to Brown Disc Products.\n  \n\n"], ["test/19666", "acq", "CORADIAN &lt;CDIN.O> STAKE ACQUIRED BY SAGE\n  Coradian Corp said a group led by\n  privately held Sage Equities Group agreed to buy a 7.6 pct\n  interest in Coradian.\n      In connection with the agreement, the company said it sold\n  666,667 shares at 75 cts a share.\n      It said that in addition to common stock, Sage Equities\n  will receive 667,667 warrants exercisable at 1.50 dlrs a share.\n  \n\n"], ["test/21264", "earn", "TEMPLE-INLAND INC &lt;TIN> 3RD QTR NET\n  Shr 1.24 dlrs vs 66 dlrs\n      Net 38.2 mln vs 20.1 mln\n      Revs 419.1 mln vs 333.8 mln\n      Nine mths\n      Shr 3.50 dlrs vs 1.74 dlrs\n      Net 107.7 mln vs 53 mln\n      Revs 1.2 billion vs 940 mln\n  \n\n"], ["test/17770", "acq", "U.S. BANCORP &lt;USBC.O> HAS ACQUISITION APPROVAL\n  U.S. Bancorp (Oregon) said it has\n  been advised orally that its application for the acquisition of\n  Old National Bancorp has been approved by the Board of\n  Governors of the Federal Reserve.\n      The company said it has also been advised that it has\n  received Fed approvals for its acquisition of Heritage Bank of\n  Camas, Wash., and for its conversion of its subsidiary, U.S.\n  Thrift and Loan of Salt Lake City, Utah, into a commercial\n  bank.\n      In January U.S. Bancorp and Old National reached a\n  definitive agreement covering the acquisition of all the stock\n  of Old National which it does not already own for 171 mln dlrs.\n      U.S. Bancorp currently owns 4.9 pct of Old National's\n  stock.\n  \n\n"], ["test/19283", "acq", "STIFEL FINANCIAL &lt;SF> RECEIVES MERGER PROPOSAL\n  Stifel Financial Corp said it\n  received an unsolicited merger proposal from privately held\n  Laidlaw Adams and Peck Inc for 15 dlrs a share in cash for all\n  its outstanding shares.\n      The proposal, which expires July 1, values Stifel at about\n  54 mln dlrs.\n      Stifel has about 3.6 mln shares outstanding.\n      The company said its management and board of directors will\n  consider the proposal but have not set a date to meet.\n      It said the proposal is currently being studied by Goldman\n  Sachs and Co and legal counsel.\n      It said conditions of the proposal include obtaining\n  necessary financing, satisfactory completion of a due diligence\n  investigation by Laidlaw, and execution of employment contracts\n  with key employees to be designated by Laidlaw.\n  \n\n"], ["test/20941", "money-fx", "TREASURY'S BAKER MET WEST GERMANY'S STOLTENBERG TODAY, AGREED TO SUPPORT LOUVRE PACT\n\n  TREASURY'S BAKER MET WEST GERMANY'S STOLTENBERG TODAY, AGREED TO SUPPORT LOUVRE PACT\n  \n\n"], ["test/16718", "acq", "DOTRONIX INC &lt;DOTX.O> TO BUY &lt;VIDEO MONITORS>\n  Dotronix Inc said it agreed\n  in principle to buy Video Monitors Inc, a privately-held\n  company.\n      In payment for the acquisition, Dotronix will issue 312,500\n  unregistered shares of its common stock, notes worth 1.8 mln\n  dlrs payable over three years, and about 70,000 dlrs in cash.\n      Dotronix said Video Monitors' sales for the fiscal year\n  ended April 30, 1986, were 7.6 mln dlrs.

Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in\n  November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.\n      \"I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and\n  more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands\n  to make a ton of money,\" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson\n  Lehman Brothers Inc. \"In play\" is a term used on Wall Street to\n  describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling\n  takeover target.\n      Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon\n  gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through\n  November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per\n  share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of\n  three yesterday.\n      The agreement would be calculated on the basis of\n  Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a\n  split.

Venezuela's central bank has ordered\n  Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange\n  operations with brokers based outside the country, according to\n  a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.\n      The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has\n  effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's\n  volatile currency market.\n      The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez\n  Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international\n  operations.\n      The telex said the restriction on business with foreign\n  brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign\n  exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign\n  currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.\n      In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied\n  rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to\n  prop up the weakening bolivar.\n      But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de\n  facto currency control. \"It is definitely a control in the sense\n  that there's no longer complete freedom to operate,\" one broker\n  here said.\n      \"Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction\n  is towards complete control,\" the broker said.\n      The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his\n  Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since\n  the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with\n  telephone calls.\n      He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume\n  of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs\n  a day. \"It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active,\" he\n  said.\n      The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the\n  prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary\n  between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.\n      \"We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's\n  ridiculous,\" he said. \"They've been on a rampage against\n  foreigners.\"\n      The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central\n  bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange\n  business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct\n  reserve requirement.\n      In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in\n  bolivar futures, the broker said.\n      \"We used to have a forward market,\" he said. \"For a small\n  currency it was miraculous.\"\n      He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.\n  Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range\n  of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running\n  out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free\n  market.\n  \n\n"], ["test/19684", "crude", "CHANCES OF DIRECT U.S.-IRAN GULF CLASH SEEN LOW\n  U.S. moves to increase its warships in\n  and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on\n  unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a\n  direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said.\n      They said the American decision inevitably carries some\n  risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt\n  rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.\n      \"As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the\n  Gulf could do serious damage,\" said one western diplomat.\n      Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks\n  on \"soft targets\" such as merchant shipping not protected by\n  American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.\n      The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil\n  tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated\n  by diplomats as low. However, \"There is the threat that the\n  Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,\n  will go for softer targets,\" one diplomat said.\n      Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar\n  Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was\n  \"moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.\"\n      The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10\n  warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to\n  patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.\n      The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting\n  Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered\n  to fly the American flag to give them naval protection.\n      Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by\n  Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.\n      Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by\n  Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is\n  preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.\n      The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to\n  make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.\n      A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a\n  launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the\n  Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.\n      \"But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti\n  territory would be a very serious escalation\" likely moving\n  world opinion against Iran, remarked one.\n      Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying\n  out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.\n      Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted\n  last Friday \"a river of blood\" throughout the world in the event\n  of any U.S. strike against Iran.\n      Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused\n  of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable\n  capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.\n      Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that\n  most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to\n  pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential\n  trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.\n      Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or\n  other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.\n  \n\n"], ["test/16417", "earn", "MYERS INDUSTRIES INC &lt;MYE> 1ST QTR NET\n  Shr 22 cts vs 18 cts\n      Net 803,708 vs 642,534\n      Sales 21.0 ln vs 18.8 mln\n      NOTE: Per share figures adjusted for ten pct stock dividend\n  paid August 1986.\n  \n\n"], ["test/14971", "earn", "GEODYNAMICS CORP &lt;GDYN> 3RD QTR FEB 27 NET\n  Shr 21 cts vs 20 cts\n      Net 596,000 vs 594,000\n      Revs 8,693,000 vs 8,164,000\n      Nine mths\n      Shr 61 cts vs 58 cts\n      Net 1,784,000 vs 1,653,000\n      Revs 26.3 mln vs 23.0 mln\n  \n\n"], ["test/15011", "earn", "F.W.

The price gyrations have\n  combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented\n  volatility to some U.S. securities markets.\n      At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some\n  lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate\n  takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers\n  steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.\n      And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign\n  exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork\n  for an international securities marketplace in which trading\n  occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.\n      Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment\n  opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce\n  U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.\n      Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial\n  disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,\n  eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to\n  spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's\n  review of hostile corporate takeovers.\n      Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton\n  investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to\n  the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.\n      In line with the views of other top administration\n  officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover\n  battles over new federal regulations.\n      The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider\n  trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that\n  topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the\n  administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.\n      Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with\n  Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to\n  significantly alter the commission's current priorities.\n      The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them\n  lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that\n  figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the\n  agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.\n      The agency is one of the few in the government that\n  actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past\n  few years because of fees it charges public companies,\n  investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.\n      The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,\n  meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the\n  president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing\n  for policy differences alone.\n      By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same\n  political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request\n  each year instead of leaving this to the White House.\n      Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins\n  to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed\n  in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted\n  market manipulations by large investment firms.\n      The agency requires public companies and investment\n  vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on\n  their financial condition and to disclose changes in their\n  condition any time they issue new securities.\n      It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to\n  register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and\n  it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.\n      Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial\n  magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to\n  become the nation's 35th president.\n      Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served\n  from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in\n  1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's\n  first term and was Reagan's director of the Central\n  Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.\n  \n\n"], ["test/15281", "acq", "DAY INT'L &lt;DAY> TO SELL UNIT\n  Day International Corp said it has\n  entered into a letter of intent to sell its Allen Industries\n  Inc unit to a group including the unit's current management.\n      Day said the sale could enable Day to accelerate its\n  earnings for its current fiscal year ending October 31, 1987.\n      \"Net earnings for the full year (ending October 31)\n  should be in the ball park of some analysts' estimates of 16\n  mln dlrs to 19 mln dlrs,\" Richard Jacob, Day chairman and chief\n  executive officer said.\n      Day reported earnings of 3.1 mln dlrs, or 39 cts a share,\n  in fiscal 1986.\n      Day said the agreement is subject to the preparation and\n  negotiation of a definitive agreement and the ability of the\n  group to obtain financing.\n  \n\n"], ["test/15596", "acq", "PHOENIX FINANCIAL &lt;PHFC> BUYS DATA ACCESS STAKE\n  Data Access Systems Inc said\n  chairman David Cohen has sold 1,800,000 common shares to\n  Phoenix Financial corp for undisclosed terms and resigned as\n  chairman and chief executive officer.\n      The company said Phoenix Financial now has a 27 pct\n  interest in Data Access and effective control.\n      Data Access said Phoenix chairman Martin S.

But officials noted that Poehl has worked\n  closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard\n  Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.\n      Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul\n  Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international\n  reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.\n      Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook\n  Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor\n  Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was\n  Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as\n  Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.\n      In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the\n  dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of\n  the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution\n  which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent\n  inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts\n  of galloping inflation this century.\n      But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and\n  inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe\n  to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the\n  dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.\n      \"I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the\n  dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the\n  Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark\n  would endanger the economy in West Germany,\" he told business\n  journalists in Frankfurt recently.\n      Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that\n  Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.\n      \"Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not\n  focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external\n  economy,\" she said.\n      An economist at a German bank, who declined to be\n  identified, said \"If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will\n  certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so\n  rigidly oriented towards money supply.\"\n      One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to\n  persuade the United States to stop \"talking down\" the dollar. For\n  Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that\n  the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise\n  currencies.\n      The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency\n  dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in\n  fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.\n      \"This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they\n  don't know - what the central banks can do,\" Poehl says of\n  intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates\n  round, making a speculator's position worthless.\n      Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist\n  in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.\n      A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over\n  a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.\n      He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and\n  play golf.\n      Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute\n  for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.\n      \"But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount\n  if you strike at the right moment,\" he said. Bundesbank dealers\n  are very professional and skilled. \"They've burnt the fingers of\n  many people,\" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,\n  the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.\n  \n\n"], ["test/15363", "acq", "MORE AMERICAN BRANDS &lt;AMB> ACQUISITIONS SEEN\n  American Brands Inc's 545 mln dlrs\n  acquisition of National Distillers and Chemical Corp's liquor\n  business is expected to be one of a series of acquisitions by\n  the tobacco company, analysts said.\n       \"They were very frustrated with their inability to get\n  Chesebrough.

interest\n  rates, European economists said.\n      But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing\n  the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were\n  plunging.\n      West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.\n  Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to\n  currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,\n  according to official statements released late Monday.\n      Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the\n  Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks\n  liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct\n  facility rate offered last week.\n      While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank\n  president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added\n  money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a\n  strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.\n       \"It's round one to the Americans, \" said Richard Reid,\n  senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in\n  London.\n      But Reid added, \"We shouldn't forget that it has taken one\n  of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West\n  Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05\n  percentage point.\"\n      Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening\n  of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and\n  fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.\n      Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's\n  Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary\n  policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -\n  the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.\n      The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets\n  and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading\n  in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was\n  quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.\n      Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche\n  Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world\n  stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West\n  German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.\n      \"The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market\n  losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits\n  with Baker's wishes, then all the better,\" he said.\n      No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the\n  Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises\n  in the U.S., Aschoff said.\n      Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central\n  bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he\n  thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.\n      Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston\n  Ltd in London said \"The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat\n  and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the\n  security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was\n  before the IMF meeting last month in Washington.\"\n      Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was\n  reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity\n  at 3.60 pct, Keating noted.\n      Economists said the United States now appeared to have\n  agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support\n  the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.\n      Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder\n  Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg\n  told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule\n  out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening\n  on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.\n      Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West\n  Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency\n  stability.

Wang\n  took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought\n  15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3\n  mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.\n      Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer\n  businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe\n  computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.\n      Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the\n  merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.\n      On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six\n  companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.\n      For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on\n  sales of 141.5 mln dlrs.\n      The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely\n  because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,\n  Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the\n  dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or\n  56 cts a share.\n     At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different\n  businesses, only three of which were involved in computer\n  software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a\n  major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his\n  job as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer services\n  unit.\n      Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a\n  news conference that the merger would give computer users a\n  single source for a wide range of software products.\n      In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also\n  sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads\n  in the applications software market, where analysts said it has\n  been successful with accounting and banking systems.\n      Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and\n  enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the\n  company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said\n  about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.\n      Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of\n  current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But\n  they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute\n  Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.\n      Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of\n  completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,\n  he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05\n  dlrs a share.\n      Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations\n  of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing\n  and research and development.\n      Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.\n  Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50\n  dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly\n  33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.\n      Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most\n  software companies are currently valued at about 20 times\n  per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the\n  premium because of its earnings potential and customer base.\n  \n      Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25\n  pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently\n  owns 58 pct of Uccel.\n      The executive said the merger would not alter his target of\n  maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.\n      In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the\n  deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice\n  Department.\n      Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the\n  merger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.\n  \n\n"], ["test/19171", "earn", "AMERICAN GREETINGS CORP &lt;AGREA.O> 1ST QTR NET\n  Period ended May 31\n      Shr 42 cts vs 53 cts\n      Net 13,600,000 vs 17,100,000\n      Revs 263.3 mln vs 243.8 mln\n  \n\n"], ["test/19006", "acq", "SQUIBB &lt;SQB> SAID NOT INTERESTED IN BUYING CETUS\n  Robert Fildes, president and chief\n  executive of Cetus Corp &lt;CTUS.O>, told Reuters that Squibb Corp\n  is not interested in buying Cetus.\n      Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a\n  five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs.\n      \"This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major\n  majority holder in Cetus,\" Fildes told Reuters in an interview.\n  \"Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they\n  want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind\n  of arrangement,\" said Fildes.\n      Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments\n  by Fildes.\n      Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only\n  one to own an equity position in Cetus.

He added that West German growth forecasts would\n  have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop\n  to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.\n      Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets\n  had parted company with transactions in goods, services and\n  investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that\n  determined market trends.\n      Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to\n  grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates\n  would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.\n      \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are\n  different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --\n  those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of\n  mounting economic activity,\" Koehler said.\n      The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.\n  Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation\n  going by talking the dollar down posed problems.\n      The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep\n  rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost\n  of European imports.

Wednesday borrowings were\n  1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.\n      \"One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it\n  probably isn't,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.\n      Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy\n  modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the\n  two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging\n  around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.\n      However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest\n  two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand\n  often pushes up borrrowings.\n      \"Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it\n  looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions\n  late in the statement period and didn't quite make it,\" said\n  Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\n      A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that\n  the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or\n  more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.\n      Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in\n  its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer\n  reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.\n      The Fed took no market reserve management action last\n  Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added\n  temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of\n  customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves\n  directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n      Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the\n  two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on\n  Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's\n  overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.\n      \"It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at\n  this time,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.\n      Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi\n  said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest\n  rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak\n  economies in the United States and abroad and add to the\n  financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.\n      \"Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest\n  statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar\n  tumbled,\" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.\n      He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new\n  statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's\n  Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed\n  to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.\n      In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in\n  Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that\n  the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade\n  imbalance between the United States and Japan.\n      The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for\n  steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average\n  Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where\n  the rate has been since early November.\n      \"I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter\n  policy to help the dollar, as some suspect,\" said Sullivan of\n  Dean Witter.\n      If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just\n  nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from\n  six to 6.10 pct previously.\n  \n\n"], ["test/15582", "grain",

Others argue the merger\n  was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch\n  network from scratch.\n      The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive.

That's the kind of deregulation we want.\"\n      Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such\n  domestic securities business as profitable government bond\n  dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co\n  Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.\n      He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering\n  the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank\n  subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.\n       The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to\n  securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,\n  following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European\n  universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.\n      But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar\n  decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.\n      \"We don't want to make waves.

He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.\n      Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on \"a gradual reduction\n  of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.\"\n      He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced\n  \"satisfactory exchange rate stability,\" in part thanks to heavy\n  coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and\n  he was \"content\" with sterling's exchange rate.\n      Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May\n  currency reserves announced today he said, \"we have been playing\n  a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a\n  very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.\"\n      Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may\n  falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic\n  commitments underlying the accord.\n      \"Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange\n  rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their\n  commitments in Paris ... In this respect.\" He said the U.S.\n  Budget deficit was \"very important.\"\n      Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by\n  Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson\n  said, \"what is really needed in Japan is an increase in\n  merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.\"\n      \"There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural\n  goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is\n  wholly unjustified,\" he said.\n      Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in \"Japan\n  bashing\" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation\n  package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase\n  Japanese development aid over the next three years.\n      Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange\n  membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.\n      He said he thought West Germany would instead come under\n  pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to\n  jack up faltering economic growth.\n      In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring\n  forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts\n  scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with\n  the privatisation of German national industries.\n      On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan\n  to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to\n  make progress in Venice.\n      The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign\n  debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World\n  Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.\n      Lawson said he would seek \"to consolidate political backing\n  for the plan at the Venice summit\" and hoped the programme would\n  be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.\n      He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase\n  Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt\n  provisions.\n      \"First, it is a blow for realism.

It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.\n      The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market\n  reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest\n  rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that\n  West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.\n      Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to\n  coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with\n  the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating\n  their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget\n  deficit.\n      West German government sources said rising West German\n  money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre\n  pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest\n  rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising\n  since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed\n  raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.\n      German yields have also risen over this period, but less\n  markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up\n  short-term rates by changing the terms on its security\n  repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the\n  money market.\n      The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,\n  compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's\n  inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,\n  but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the\n  Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary\n  growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,\n  bank economists said.\n      This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the\n  pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl\n  since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the\n  more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.\n      In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,\n  the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this\n  morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.\n  anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.\n      \"They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much\n  under American fire,\" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at\n  Swiss Bank Corp here.\n      \"It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a\n  significant retreat from its position,\" added Giles Keating,\n  economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.\n      The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of\n  the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact\n  on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market\n  economists said.\n      Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank\n  does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation\n  rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,\n  little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.\n      The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication\n  that the meeting would take place, although the Finance\n  Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.\n      Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to\n  comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre\n  accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he\n  assumed monetary cooperation would continue.\n      The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West\n  Germany for Sweden on Monday.

Interest rates fell\n  sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.\n      But that confidence is now cracking as the financial\n  markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's\n  often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.\n      \"Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar\n  freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,\" said\n  David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.\n      The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in\n  40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington\n  failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a\n  credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short\n  of further depreciation of the dollar.\n      Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid\n  worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare\n  away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.\n      The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12\n  dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike\n  in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down\n  by 33 points to 2339.\n      Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the\n  markets' instability frightening. He believes economic\n  fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that \"once\n  you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.\"\n      \"There's a stark possibility that you could get a\n  destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates\n  and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.\"\n      Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics\n  in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the\n  controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and\n  264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.\n      \"We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But\n  the agony may be fairly drawn out,\" Marris told Reuters.\n      Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this\n  year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it\n  would take very little to touch off what he calls the second\n  phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the\n  dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.\n      The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on\n  March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.\n      The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with\n  historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are\n  not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its\n  decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.\n      Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest\n  weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks\n  suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling\n  below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as\n  part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.\n      Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of\n  confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced\n  plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic\n  imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.\n      Many economists believe that long-run stability will not\n  return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is\n  addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the\n  massive budget deficit.\n      But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of\n  central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no\n  choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.\n      \"The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a\n  substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding\n  cut abroad, at least by Japan,\" said Lanston's Jones.\n      Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest\n  rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for\n  American farmers, Latin American governments and others.\n      But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and\n  Co, scoffed at the notion. \"It's ridiculous to think the Federal\n  Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak\n  against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar\n  weakness,\" he said.\n      Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being\n  made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.\n      \"We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the\n  budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody\n  cares,\" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69\n  will have been greater.\n      He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and\n  thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.\n      But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that\n  a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. \"Put on\n  your helmets,\" Giordano said.\n  \n\n"], ["test/16409", "acq", "(CORRECTED)-CRAZY EDDIE &lt;CRZY.O> SETS RIGHTS\n  Crazy Eddie Inc said its board has\n  adopted a defensive shareholder rights plan and said it has\n  reacived inquiries on a friendly merger.\n      It said under the plan, shareholders of record as of April\n  21 will receive a right to purchase under certain circumstances\n  at a price of 42 dlrs 0.01 preferred share for each common\n  share held.

For years the softly-spoken economist has been\n  warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply\n  growth would eventually lead to rising prices.\n      Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank\n  council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his\n  views, bankers said.\n      \"Poehl is in a minority in his own house,\" said Commerzbank's\n  Pfister.\n      \"Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not\n  entirely his own,\" said another economist.\n      The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,\n  they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark\n  and hurting West German exporters.\n      The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the\n  Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.\n      Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James\n  Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.\n      Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986\n  war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.\n  Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to\n  stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.\n      One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round\n  of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.\n      But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for\n  Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.\n      The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted\n  most popular government politician last year, had to face\n  resistance from local barons in the government coalition\n  parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.\n      The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising\n  4.3 billion marks.\n      But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will\n  push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the\n  government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.\n      Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row\n  which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.\n      Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last\n  month early to sort out a row in the northern state of\n  Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.\n      The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after\n  allegations of a \"dirty tricks\" election campaign led to heavy\n  losses for the CDU in state elections.\n      Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last\n  weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.\n      Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more\n  remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and\n  was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.\n      When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this\n  year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government\n  gave Poehl another eight-year term.\n      Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he\n  hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.\n      But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was\n  not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the\n  Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.\n  \n\n"], ["test/17503", "grain", "FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's\n  forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will\n  almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be\n  surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.\n      The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'\n  Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal\n  Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or\n  end-of-season stocks.\n      However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end\n  1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln\n  was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.\n      The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast\n  in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for\n  soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and\n  the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.\n      This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around\n  31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of\n  Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares\n  against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.\n      ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign\n  will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC\n  official said.\n      Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to\n  estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and\n  to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.\n      He said, however, that among countries to which France\n  could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb\n  countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.\n      The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in\n  1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,\n  was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize\n  Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.\n      Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were\n  expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.\n      It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,\n  down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.\n  \n\n"], ["test/20669", "earn", "PETROLANE PARTNERS L.P. &lt;LPG> 3RD QTR LOSS\n  Shr loss five cts vs profit six cts\n      Net loss 1,200,000 vs profit 1,400,000\n      Nine mths\n      Shr profit 1.00 dlrs vs profit 84 cts\n      Net profit 23.7 mln vs profit 19.9 mln\n      NOTE: Year ago results are pro forma since the company was\n  created in March by the transfer to a master limited\n  partnership of all domestic assets of Petrolane Inc's liquefied\n  petroleum gas division.\n  \n\n"], ["test/16243", "acq", "P.H.

Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains\n  subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat\n  and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs\n  and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.\n      House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has\n  said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.\n      But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to\n  be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and\n  a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said\n  freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major\n  grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget\n  savings Glickman claims.\n      Another area where Glickman and other have said budget\n  savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,\n  ARP, levels for wheat and corn.\n      However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand\n  within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop\n  wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30\n  pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most\n  commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.\n      Congressional sources said the only way to achieve\n  significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost\n  the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said\n  singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as\n  unfair to one commodity.\n      Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most\n  likely to eventually look for budget savings are some\n  tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible \n  adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.\n      Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion\n  but not enough, they said.\n      Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture\n  committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on\n  all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price\n  support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the\n  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.\n      This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau\n  Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.\n  \n\n"], ["test/15161", "acq", "U.K. GEC DECLINES COMMENT ON U.S. PURCHASE RUMOUR\n  General Electric Co Plc &lt;GECL.L> (GEC)\n  declined comment on rumours on the London stock market that it\n  is planning another purchase in the U.S. Medical equipment\n  field, in addition to its existing U.S. Subsidiary &lt;Picker\n  International Inc>.\n      A GEC spokesman said that it is company policy not to\n  comment on acquisition rumours.\n      Stock Exchange traders said the rumour helped GEC's share\n  price to rise 5p, to a final 206p from yesterday's closing\n  price of 201p.\n  \n\n"], ["test/16307", "acq", "PENTLAND TO REDUCE REEBOK &lt;RBK> HOLDINGS\n  Pentland Industries PLC said it report\n  a substantial capital gain from the sale of part of its\n  holdings in Reebok International Limited, which will cut its\n  stake in Reebok to 32.2 pct from 36.7 pct.\n       It said Reebok filed a registration statement with the\n  Securities and Exchange Commission for the offering of six mln\n  shares of Reebok common.

However, he\n  said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation\n  expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates\n  in the longer term.\n      In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,\n  or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts\n  point to a falling rate of economic growth.\n      \"It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement\n  negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,\"\n  the ABN economist said.\n      He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in\n  January, could also contribute to some inflation.\n      At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to\n  two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,\n  currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the\n  second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.\n      Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying\n  spree on the bond market which would bring yields down,\n  probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below\n  five pct.\n      Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in\n  the money market.\n  \n\n"], ["test/16380", "earn", "U.S. TRUST CORP &lt;USTC.O> 1ST QTR NET\n  Shr primary 88 cts vs 83 cts\n      Shr diluted 84 cts vs 78 cts\n      Net 8,869,000 vs 8,176,000\n      Avg Assets 2.62 billion vs 2.42 billion\n      Deposits 2.06 billion vs 1.80 billion\n  \n\n"], ["test/17922", "earn", "DE LA RUE RAISES ANNUAL PROFITS BY 12.7 PCT\n  Year ended March 31, 1987\n      Fin div 9.25p making 12p vs 10.74p\n      Shr 28.3p vs 27.5p\n      Pretax profit 55.63 mln stg vs 49.36 mln\n      Net 38.80 mln vs 33.64 mln\n      Turnover 444.10 mln vs 309.85 mln\n      Net interest payable 3.50 mln vs 3.79 mln\n      Profit share of related companies 7.62 mln vs 9.64 mln\n      Note - The De La Rue Co.

That, I\n  think, was partly due to statements that have been made by\n  senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic.\" It was a\n  dispute that should never have happened, he added.\n      Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a\n  hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  \n  still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United\n  States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to\n  Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.\n      Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, \"His\n  timing could not have been worse.\"\n      One government bond salesman in New York said, \"He actually\n  thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack\n  the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much\n  understanding of international monetary gamesmanship.\"\n      However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march\n  toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.\n      \"On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if\n  you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial\n  markets), it was West German policy,\" said Robert Brusca of\n  Nikko Securities International in New York.\n      \"All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so\n  making him responsible for it was a little like killing the\n  messenger,\" he said.\n      After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments\n  made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together\n  in Paris in February, was still in effect.\n      Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be\n  a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to\n  the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash\n  wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.\n     Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about\n  Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the\n  global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest\n  rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.\n      He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th\n  month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic\n  expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge\n  market for debtor country exports.\n      Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried\n  that the Republican party might face next year's presidential\n  election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly\n  tarnished.\n      A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt\n  crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has\n  already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.\n      \"There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the\n  economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around\n  quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and\n  eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,\"\n  former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a\n  television interview.\n      In many ways, the official response was mild.\n      Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,\n  with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting\n  that he was \"puzzled.\"\n      U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately\n  returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments\n  and, presumably, their political impact.\n      For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in\n  Washington will diminish because of the market fall.\n      Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because\n  of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd\n  Bentsen said with some irony, \"Oh, I think it's much too late to\n  be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the\n  attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---\n  retire to the living room to take a nap.

The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and\n  would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.\n      OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of\n  16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and\n  retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord\n  based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.\n      OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and\n  it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter\n  ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth\n  quarter.\n      Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore\n  fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from\n  planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained\n  within its December accord on output and prices.\n      Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around\n  840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln\n  bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.\n      The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since\n  February reduced Norway's oil
